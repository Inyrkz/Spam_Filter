# Spam_Filter
In this project, I trained a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam. 
This project makes use of Natural Language Processing.

The notebook used for training is `spam_filter_implementation.ipynb`.

I used the `Bag of Words` model and the `TF-IDF` models to extract the features from the texts.

The machine learning algorithms used for training are:
- Naive Bayes,
- Logistic Regression, 
- SVM (linear, poly and rbf kernel)
- 
The script for the Flask REST Api is `spam.py`.
